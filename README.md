Second Screenshot shows the Sales, Profit and Quantity just for the "Montana" Product in the year 2013 and 2014.

Third Screenshot shows all the Sales and profit just for the january month of the year 2014.

Fourth Screenshot shows all the important KPI's and trends of the year 2014 only.

As you can see that this Dashboard is totally interactive with each other.
This dashboard was created as part of my learning and application in financial data analysis and dashboard storytelling using Power BI.

Thankyou.
